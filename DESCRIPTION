Description: To improve implementation of the Endangered Species Act, the U.S Fish and
  Wildlife Service (FWS) develops a 7-year workplan to prioritize ESA listing and critical habitat decisions.
  The data included in this package was created by extracting the tables from the National Listing Workplan
  PDF found in the FWS Endangered Species Act Document Library \url{https://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library}.
  The package contains a function to launch an interactive web app that can be used to explore this data.
