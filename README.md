# ESA Listing Workplan

An R package and Shiny app to explore the workplan for listing species under the ESA. [Live app](https://cci-dev.org/shiny/open/listing-workplan/)

## Summary

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) released a 7-year workplan used to 
prioritize ongoing species status reviews. FWS uses two different prioritization 
schemes; a 1-5 priority bin for status reviews of non-candidate species, and the 
Listing Priority Number (LPN) of current candidate species. The app that is a
part of this R package provides a simple interface to explore the prioritization.

for more additional information.
